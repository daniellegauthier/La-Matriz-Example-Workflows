    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
    Risky behavior is framed as individual failure. Parents are expected to emotionally support their children with full financial obligations, with 46% of all new income from global economic growth since 1980 going to the richest 5%. We never catch up in our rest banks once we make it past childhood because care is an unrewarded commodity.
    <br><br>
    Deficit narratives sell. People would rather engage with what they know and like. We need designs that teach, rather than simply label.
    <br><br>
    People repeat lines as expected instead of creating genuine feedback. Even the people with the most power aren't free in their bodies. My family has achieved social mobility to the top 1% through immigration from Hispañola with education.
    <br><br>
    We are so constricted in our decisions with current social striations that our news is beginning to show wilder stories every day. Instead of teaching healthy decisions, current algorithms replicate all of our behaviors. Social stigmas are embedded in design from sourcing our histories.
    <br><br>
    Bucket sorting offers a linear model for time. We sort based on attracting what we like, and not what we learn from. Sorting allows for data intimacy.
    <br><br>
    Deterministic models of story forms that shape healing can preconfigure a pathway when data is missing using apophenia. Once the physical momentum is determined through one conformal metaphor, it is preserved through changed variables in the same category of sentiment, as determined by color. This is expressed through the significance of colors in the sorting of sentiment; word similarity of color vector to word vector is a significant correlation.
    <br><br>
    Just like spaces prescribe how we exist within them, contexts in stories carry when data variables change. Different cultures are partial to different story maps. Color sorting with story forms allows for transversal over a spatial map of sentiment to verify message with meaning.
    <br><br>
    Mobility through structural boundaries becomes unleashed. By creating intimacy with data, learning becomes more playful and comfortable. Sorting with 13 colors applies faith to action.
    <br><br>
    Self embrace from nullifying harm by enforcing consent is the way we swim in water. We feel our own selves when we touch the atmosphere, so we intuitively learn how to balance the connection with external harmony. Emitting and interpreting echoes, like a whale's echolocation, can help with navigational sensing.
    <br><br>
    Subjectivity is always contained in objectivity because subjects can never be removed from their objects. All color interpretations are valid, and meaningful. There is a circular gradient of meaning for complimentary opposites.
    <br><br>
    Sorting with 13 colors rejects the null hypothesis. By removing precision on labels, access becomes inclusive. Our perspectives become revealed by our choices in labeling, rather than projecting forward.
    <br><br>
    Data intimacy through play with color bucket sorting can increase access to care. I dedicate and offer this work to stewards of land and body safety. A prayer for co-liberation.

    Here is a policy letter written in a lyrical yet precise style, grounded in the outputs from the JSON file:
<br><br>
To transform our collective future, we must first acknowledge the determinism of social construction. The personal politics of identity and community are intertwined, as reflected in the experiences of minority citizens, particularly those with at-risk health. Our intention is to resist the external imposition of autonomy and instead co-create a design for a more equitable future.
<br><br>
The body experience of health impact demands a localized change, which can only be achieved through public support. By addressing the resource extraction that depletes our social capital, we can preserve the symbol of resistance and create a new social innovation.
<br><br>
To end the origin of community-led efforts being derailed by political resistance, we must first identify and rectify the leak of information and resources. This requires an adaptation to the changing landscape, fueled by hope and guided by transitional principles.
<br><br>
Ultimately, our policy critique must prioritize the well-being of those most affected, ensuring that public support is mobilized to address the obstacles of social depletion. By doing so, we can depict a brighter future, one where TikTok users are empowered to express themselves freely, without fear of censorship or manipulation.
<br><br>
Let us work together to create a more just and equitable world, grounded in truth and moving forward with purpose.

    <h2>Alchemize with Color</h2>
    <p>
      To use this tabular, find the above color meaning you want to attract or release. <br>
      <br>
      To attract a color, find the sequences with high Gross National Happiness scores of that color. They will have the longest bars of the matching color.<br>
      <br>
      To repel a color, find the sequences with lowest Gross National Happiness scores for that color. They will have the shortest bars of the matching color.<br>
      <br>
      The power of metaphor and story, mixed with the containment of conformal shapes, preserving angles but not distances, allows for controlled, bottom-up navigation.  <br>
      <br>
    </p>
      <h2>Reading the Line Graphs</h2>
      <p>
        To interpret the momentum plots we are looking at color sequences as wave-like signals of color derived from RGB arrays.
<br><br>
Each RGB array within a sequence is treated as a discrete signal. When converted into complex momentum, it behaves like a wave packet, where:<br>
<br>
* Real part → cosine-like component (in-phase wave)<br>
* Imaginary part → sine-like component (quadrature wave)<br>
* Magnitude → wave energy (amplitude)<br>
* Phase → wave direction & interference state<br>
        <br>
Think of each color as a separate oscillatory mode.
      </p>
<h3>1. Real Part of Momentum → Standing / Traveling Wave</h3>
<p>
* Represents the in-phase oscillation<br>
* Smooth variation → coherent wave<br>
* Sharp sign changes → reflections or boundaries<br>
* Positive → forward propagation<br>
* Negative → reverse or reflected wave<br>
* Symmetry → standing wave behavior<br>
* Small-amplitude oscillations indicate low-energy but coherent waves.
      </p>
<h3>B. Imaginary Part of Momentum → Phase-Shifted Wave</h3>
      <p>
* Represents the 90° shifted component<br>
* Strong oscillations → rotating or spiral wave motion<br>
* Zero crossings → resonance nodes<br>
* Large swings → phase instability or mode switching
      </p>
<h3>C. Magnitude of Momentum → Wave Energy Womb</h3>
      <p>
* Flat magnitude → energy-conserving wave<br>
* Spikes → localized excitation<br>
* Drops → damping or destructive interference<br>
* Nearly constant magnitude ⇒ stable wave packet. This confirms no energy loss, only phase rotation
      </p>
<h3>D. Phase of Momentum → Wave Direction & Interference</h3>
      <p>
This is the most important wave diagnostic.<br>
        <br>
Phase Behavior : Meaning<br>
Linear change :	Traveling wave<br>
Sudden jumps : Phase / mode change<br>
Oscillatory	: Standing or beating wave<br>
        <br>
* Different RGB arrays → different phase trajectories<br>
* Crossing ±π → wave inversion
      </p>
      <h3>E. Trajectory Plot → Wave Path in Space</h3>
      <p>
The trajectory plots show how the wave moves through space over time.<br>
        <br>
Interpret as:<br>
        <br>
* Points → wave samples<br>
* Lines → propagation path<br>
* Color gradient → time evolution<br>
* Straight line → uniform propagation<br>
* Zig-zag → interference or reflection<br>
* Closed loops → standing wave or resonance cavity<br>
* Knots / crossings → topological wave modes<br>
        <br>
      </p>
    <h2>Setting the Womb: The Knot Container</h2>
    <h3>0. Land & Lineage Acknowledgement</h3>
    <p>
    Begin by orienting to place and inheritance.<br>
    <br>
    This includes:<br>
    <br>
    * A land acknowledgement honoring the ancestral and ecological context of where the work is taking place<br>
    * An intentional lineage acknowledgement, informed by the above Color World<br>
    <br>
    This step establishes that the work does not belong solely to the individual, it is held within a wider field of relation.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Identify the Block</h3>
    <p>
    Name, do not solve, the current block.<br>
    <br>
    The block may appear as:<br>
    <br>
    * Emotional stagnation<br>
    * Repetitive relational patterns<br>
    * Somatic tension or numbness<br>
    * Cognitive loops or loss of meaning<br>
    <br>
    This step locates where the Knot has formed, without forcing interpretation or self-correction.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Reading</h3>
    <p>
    A short, curated reading to attune the nervous system and symbolic mind.<br>
    <br>
    The reading functions as:<br>
    <br>
    * A tuning fork for shared resonance<br>
    * A permission slip to move beyond linear logic<br>
    * A softening of internal surveillance<br>
    <br>
    The reading is not instructional; it is atmospheric.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Guided Visualization & Meditation</h3>
    <p>
    A guided visualization invites participants into the body and imaginal field.<br>
    <br>
    This meditation:<br>
    <br>
    * Establishes internal safety and orientation<br>
    * Activates somatic awareness before analysis<br>
    * Prepares the psyche to encounter shadow without fragmentation<br>
    <br>
    The aim is not transcendence, but presence.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Knot Sequence</h3>
    <p>
    The Knot sequence is introduced as the core womb structure.<br>
    <br>
    The Knot:<br>
    <br>
    * Holds contradiction without collapse<br>
    * Allows intensity to arise alongside boundaries<br>
    * Prevents premature meaning-making<br>
    <br>
    This sequence supports participants in staying with what is entangled, rather than bypassing it.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Plot Sequence</h3>
    <p>
    Once the Knot is stabilized, the Plot sequence traces how the block came into being.<br>
    <br>
    Here we examine:<br>
    <br>
    * How value, attachment, or survival strategies shaped the story<br>
    * Where influence or adaptation altered integrity<br>
    * How movement began, stalled, or diverted<br>
    <br>
    The Plot restores narrative continuity without blame.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Additional Sequences (As Needed)</h3>
    <p>
    Other sequences may be introduced selectively (Pain, Sad, Fem, Direct, etc.), depending on what colors/Gross National Happiness indicators the material calls for.<br>
    <br>
    These sequences are not additive - they are responsive, offering specific pathways for different complimentary oppositions.
    </p>
    <h3>7. Physical Trajectory Reflection</h3>
    <p>
    Reflect on how the work moved through the body.<br>
    <br>
    This includes noticing:<br>
    <br>
    * Shifts in posture, breath, or tension<br>
    * Moments of contraction or expansion<br>
    * Where clarity felt embodied rather than conceptual<br>
    <br>
    The body is treated as data, not metaphor.
    </p>
    <h3>8. Discussion & Shedding</h3>
    <p>
    Participants are invited to share selectively, with emphasis on:<br>
    <br>
    * Accountability rather than confession<br>
    * Witnessing rather than fixing<br>
    * Naming what is being released, returned
      </p>
    <h3>9. Closing</h3>
    <p>
    The container should be closed intentionally to protect the findings. This may include:<br>
    <br>
    * A brief grounding statement<br>
    * A return to land and lineage<br>
    * A reminder that integration continues beyond the session<br>
    <br>
    The womb is sealed, not to trap, but to protect what has been created.<br>
    <br>
    This process is not therapy, diagnosis, or performance. It is a sovereign space where shadow is allowed to exist long enough to reorganize itself, held by color, sequence, body, and consent.
